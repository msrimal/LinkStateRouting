# LinkStateRouting
A multi-threaded C program simulating link‑state routing over N nodes. Uses UDP sockets for cost updates, pthreads for concurrent receive and Dijkstra’s shortest‑path computation, and a mutex‑protected cost matrix. Change link costs at runtime. Visualizes updated distances in real time.
