# ğŸ“¡ Linkâ€‘State Routing Lab

A multiâ€‘threaded C program that simulates linkâ€‘state routing over N nodes. It uses UDP sockets to exchange dynamic linkâ€‘cost updates, pthreads for concurrent receive/update and Dijkstraâ€™s shortestâ€‘path computation, and a mutexâ€‘protected cost matrix.

## ğŸš€ Features

- ğŸ“¨ UDP-based link-cost broadcasts  
- ğŸ§µ Concurrent threads for receive and compute  
- ğŸ”’ Mutex-protected shared cost matrix  
- ğŸ›£ Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute shortest paths  
- ğŸ”„ Runtime link-cost changes & convergence visualization
